    <h1>Principles behind the Agile Manifesto</h1>
    <h2>Individuals and interactions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The most efficient and effective method of
        conveying information to and within a development
        team is face-to-face conversation.</li>
      <li>Build projects around motivated individuals.
        Give them the environment and support they need,
        and trust them to get the job done.</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Working software</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Deliver working software frequently, from a
        couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
        preference to the shorter timescale.</li>
      <li>Working software is the primary measure of progress.</li>
      <li>Continuous attention to technical excellence
        and good design enhances agility.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Customer collaboration</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Business people and developers must work
        together daily throughout the project.</li>
      <li>Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
        through early and continuous delivery
        of valuable software.</li>
      <li>Agile processes promote sustainable development.
        The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
        to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Responding to change</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Welcome changing requirements, even late in
        development. Agile processes harness change for
        the customer's competitive advantage.</li>
      <li>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
        to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
        its behavior accordingly.</li>
      <li>The best architectures, requirements, and designs
        emerge from self-organizing teams.</li>
    </ul>
